## Introduction

Herculean Strength is a powerlifting workout A.I. app. I decided to build it off of my interest as a competitive powerlifter, and is based on the principles of Boris Sheiko's training methods. He is a well-known figure in the powerlifting community and has trained many world-class athletes.

The app takes into account a user's age, strength and readiness to perform a workout, and generates a workout that enables the user to eventually reach their competitive goals.

The training models are built on the logic that I wrote to make the program adaptive to an athlete's capacity and strength levels. The artificial intelligence model shall be improved to make it more adaptive as it learns more about the user. The app is built using React/Next.js, with Typescript. The styling is clean and simple using Tailwind CSS.

To see the app in action, [click here](https://herculean-strength.vercel.app/). Please note it may take the website some time to load up as it is hosted on the free plan.

## Technologies

The application runs on:
- React 18.2
- Next 14.2.2
- Mongoose 8.3.2
- Typescript 5.4.5

## Setup

To run this project:
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies and dev dependencies found in package.json

```
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

## Project Status

The project is complete.

## Challenges Faced

Writing the logic for the artificial intelligence was quite challenging, but proved interesting to think of all the possible outlying conditions.

## Future Implementation

- Improve logic to make the model more adaptive according to a user's historical performance.
- Introduce email notifications
